        Write a script that will contain:
        1) Create an array of 10 integers, randomly chose by you, between 1 and 100
        2) A function that accepts an array as an argument
        3) Build an HTML table with two columns containing two columns:
         - column showing the number
         - column showing whether the number is 'odd' or 'even'
        4) You'll have to loop through the array, use the modulus operator, if/else construct, build string
